          This island has a large tree in which there is a library. In this
          place, researchers and archaeologists gather to study and find out the
          history of the world that is lost and kept secret by the World
          Government. Because of the curiosity of researchers and
          archaeologists, this is what caused the World Government to order to
          destroy this island and kill all its inhabitants.
